## Project description
SolarCore is a compact, high-efficiency DC/DC buck converter designed to operate from a 12 V solar panel deliver a 3.3 V output for embedded electronics.
The converter is based on the Texas Instruments LMR33630 and integrates measurement circuits allowing a STM32L432KC microcontroller to monitor both input and output voltage in real time.
